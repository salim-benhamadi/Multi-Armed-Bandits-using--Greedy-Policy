# Multi-Armed-Bandits-using-Greedy-Policy :slot_machine:

This project demonstrates the concept of Multi-Armed Bandits using the Greedy Policy. Multi-Armed Bandits is a classic problem in the field of reinforcement learning and decision-making. The project is implemented as a Python notebook (.ipynb), allowing you to easily run and experiment with the code.

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to explore and understand the Greedy Policy in the context of the Multi-Armed Bandits problem. The Multi-Armed Bandits problem involves a gambler (an agent) facing multiple slot machines (bandits), each with different reward probabilities. The agent's goal is to maximize its total reward over a certain number of trials.

## üìù Contents

The project repository contains the following files:

- `Multi_Armed_Bandits_using_Greedy_Policy.ipynb`: This is the main Python notebook that contains the implementation of the Multi-Armed Bandits problem using the Greedy Policy. You can run this notebook locally or on platforms like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

- `README.md`: The README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running and contributing to it.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the Multi-Armed-Bandits-using-Greedy-Policy project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/salimhammadi15/Multi-Armed-Bandits-using--Greedy-Policy.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment and navigate to the cloned repository.

3. Run the Notebook: Open the `Multi_Armed_Bandits_using_Greedy_Policy.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially. The notebook provides detailed explanations and code comments to guide you through the implementation.

4. Experiment and Explore: Once the notebook is running, feel free to experiment with different parameters, reward distributions, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Observe how the agent's performance changes and learn more about the behavior of the Greedy Policy in Multi-Armed Bandits.
